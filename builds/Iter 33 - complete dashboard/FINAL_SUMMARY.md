# Final Summary - Iteration 33

## Dashboard Files Created

1. **dashboard.html** - Initial attempt (has metadata error)
2. **dashboard-fixed.html** - Fixed metadata but scatter plot issue
3. **dashboard-working.html** - ✅ **FINAL WORKING VERSION**

## Key Solution

The issue was that the scatter plot and histograms were created as separate Vega-Lite specifications, which meant the brush parameter wasn't shared between them. The solution was to create a single combined specification using `hconcat` that includes both the histograms and scatter plot.

## Features in dashboard-working.html

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Linked brushing** works across all visualizations
- **Brush on scatter plot** updates all histograms
- **Grey bars** show full dataset, **blue bars** show selection
- **Tooltips** on all charts showing exact values

### ✅ Interactivity
- **Export selected data** as CSV
- **Export all data** as CSV
- **Clear selection** button
- **Adjustable sample size** (1k-50k points)

### ✅ Fully Offline
- All Vega, Vega-Lite, and Vega-Embed libraries are inlined
- No external dependencies or CDN calls
- Works via file:// protocol
- No source map warnings (they're just browser dev tools looking for maps)

### ✅ Professional Design
- Dark theme matching GitHub's design
- Clean layout with header and stats bar
- Real-time selection statistics
- Responsive design

## Technical Details

The key pattern for linked brushing:
```javascript
{
  "hconcat": [
    {
      "repeat": {"row": columns},
      "spec": {
        "layer": [
          {
            "params": [{"name": "brush", "select": {...}}], // Define brush here
            "mark": {"type": "bar", "color": "lightgrey"},
            // ... encoding
          },
          {
            "transform": [{"filter": {"param": "brush"}}], // Use brush here
            "mark": {"type": "bar", "color": "#1f77b4"},
            // ... encoding
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      // Scatter plot that references the same brush
      "encoding": {
        "color": {"condition": {"param": "brush", ...}},
        "opacity": {"condition": {"param": "brush", ...}}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
