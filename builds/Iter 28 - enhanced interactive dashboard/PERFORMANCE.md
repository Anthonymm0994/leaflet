# Performance Optimization Analysis

## Current Performance Characteristics
- Data: 100,030 rows sampled to 10,000 for display
- File size: ~5.13 MB (mostly JavaScript libraries)
- Initial load time: ~1-2 seconds
- Brush interaction: Real-time

## Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. Data Structure Optimizations
- TypedArrays for numeric data (Float32Array, Uint32Array)
- Pre-computed histogram bins (in preprocessed data)
- Efficient sampling algorithm

### 2. Rendering Optimizations
- Canvas rendering for scatter plots with many points
- Debounced brush updates
- Incremental rendering for large datasets

### 3. Memory Optimizations
- Lazy loading of data columns
- Efficient data filtering using indices
- Minimal object creation during interactions

### 4. Interaction Optimizations
- Throttled brush events
- Cached filter results
- Optimized selection counting

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### 1. WebAssembly
- Implement critical data operations in WASM
- 2-5x performance improvement for filtering

### 2. Web Workers
- Offload data processing to background threads
- Non-blocking UI during heavy computations

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic visualization
- Add features as they load

### 4. Data Compression
- Further compress TypedArray data
- Streaming decompression

### 5. Virtual Scrolling
- For histogram lists with many variables
- Render only visible histograms
