# Iteration 12: Histogram Report

## Goal
Create a focused, static report for analyzing the distributions of three key numerical fields:
- `width`
- `height` 
- `angle`

## Design Philosophy
- **Static Analysis**: No interactivity, pure distribution analysis
- **Clean Visualizations**: Clear histograms with statistical summaries
- **Consistent Binning**: Using D3's Scott method for optimal bin selection
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

## Technical Approach
- Uses the proven Arquero + Observable Plot combination
- Embedded Arrow data (no external dependencies)
- D3.js for histogram binning calculations
- Observable Plot for clean, minimalist visualizations

## Features
- Summary statistics cards (count, ranges)
- Three focused histograms
- Statistical info (mean, std dev, bin count)
- Responsive layout
- Dark theme for data analysis

## Current Status
- ✅ HTML structure created
- ✅ Loading states and responsive design
- ✅ Placeholder histograms with visual indicators
- ✅ Summary statistics framework
- ⏳ **Next: Full histogram implementation with real data**

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Embed libraries and data from Iteration 5 ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Implement histogram generation functions ⏳
3. **Phase 3**: Add statistical calculations ⏳
4. **Phase 4**: Test with full dataset ⏳
5. **Phase 5**: Add conditional filtering ⏳
6. **Phase 6**: Create scatter plots and radial views ⏳

## Current Features
- **Clean UI**: Dark theme optimized for data analysis
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Loading States**: Professional loading experience
- **Placeholder Visualizations**: Clear indication of where histograms will appear
- **Statistical Framework**: Ready for real data integration

## Files
- `histogram-report.html` - The main report file (current: placeholder implementation)
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
The foundation is solid. The next step is to integrate the actual data processing and visualization libraries from our working Iteration 5 version to create real histograms with your data.
