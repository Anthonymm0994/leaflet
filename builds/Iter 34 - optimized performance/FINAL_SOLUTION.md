# Iteration 34 - Final Solution

## ✅ Dashboard Created Successfully

### Files Created:
- `dashboard-final-working.html` - Full uncompressed version (5.14 MB)
- `dashboard-final-compressed.html` - Compressed version (2.5 MB)

### Key Solution:
The persistent "Duplicate signal name" error was solved by using the **exact pattern from your working example**:
- Define the brush parameter **inside the first layer of the repeat block**
- This ensures the brush is shared across all repeated histograms
- No duplicate signals are created

### Complete Features:
1. **Layered Histograms** ✅
   - Grey background bars showing all data
   - Blue overlay bars showing selected data
   - Works on all 4 histograms

2. **Brushing & Linking** ✅
   - Brush on any histogram updates all visualizations
   - Debounced updates (only on mouse release)
   - Clear selection button

3. **Dynamic Scatter Plot** ✅
   - X/Y axis selection dropdowns
   - Adjustable point density (1k-20k)
   - Filtered points based on histogram selection
   - Tooltips on hover

4. **Export Functionality** ✅
   - Export selected data
   - Export all data
   - CSV format with proper headers

5. **Performance Optimizations** ✅
   - TypedArrays for efficient memory usage
   - Sampled scatter plot (adjustable)
   - Debounced brush updates
   - Update counter

6. **Dark Theme** ✅
   - Professional dark mode styling
   - Consistent with modern dashboards

7. **Fully Offline** ✅
   - All libraries inlined
   - No external dependencies
   - Works via file:// protocol

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// The working pattern - brush defined in first layer of repeat
{
  "repeat": {"row": histColumns},
  "spec": {
    "layer": [
      {
        "params": [{
          "name": "brush",
          "select": {
            "type": "interval",
            "encodings": ["x"],
            "resolve": "global"
          }
        }],
        // Grey background bars
      },
      {
        "transform": [{"filter": {"param": "brush"}}],
        // Blue selected bars
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This pattern ensures:
- One global brush parameter
- Shared across all histograms
- No duplicate signal errors
- Proper layered visualization

The dashboard now works exactly as requested with all features intact!
