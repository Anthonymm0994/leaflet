# Optimized Data Renderer - 100k Points

This iteration explores various optimization strategies for rendering large datasets efficiently.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Canvas Rendering**
- Uses HTML5 Canvas2D for scatter plots instead of SVG
- Much faster for large numbers of points
- Lower memory footprint
- Smooth rendering of 100k+ points

### 2. **Level of Detail (LOD)**
- Adaptive sampling based on zoom level
- Adjustable max points slider (1k-100k)
- Maintains visual accuracy while improving performance

### 3. **Alternative Visualizations**
- **Density Heatmap**: Shows point density instead of individual points
- **Hexagonal Binning**: Groups points into hexagonal bins
- **Contour Plot**: Shows data density contours
- **Standard Dots**: Traditional scatter plot

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
- Real-time FPS counter
- Render time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Points rendered counter

### 5. **Optimization Controls**
- Toggle Canvas rendering on/off
- Enable/disable Quadtree indexing (placeholder)
- LOD settings
- Web Worker processing (placeholder)
- Render mode selection
- Max points adjustment

## Performance Tips

1. **Canvas Mode**: Keep enabled for best performance with dots
2. **LOD**: Enable and adjust max points based on your needs
3. **Density/Hexbin**: Use for very large datasets where individual points aren't needed
4. **Filtering**: Use histogram brushing to reduce data before detailed analysis

## Technical Implementation

- **Canvas2D API**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **D3.js**: For scales, axes, and data manipulation
- **Observable Plot**: For histograms and alternative visualizations
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth rendering updates

## Browser Compatibility

Works best in modern browsers with good Canvas2D support:
- Chrome/Edge: Excellent performance
- Firefox: Good performance
- Safari: Good performance

## Future Optimizations

- WebGL rendering for even better performance
- Web Workers for data processing
- Quadtree/R-tree for spatial indexing
- Progressive rendering
- GPU-accelerated filtering
