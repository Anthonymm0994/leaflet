# Final Solution - Working Dashboard

## ✅ Success!

Created `dashboard-working.html` using the **exact working pattern** that avoids duplicate signal errors.

## The Key Pattern:

```javascript
{
  "repeat": {"row": columns},
  "spec": {
    "layer": [
      {
        // CRITICAL: Brush defined HERE in first layer
        "params": [{
          "name": "brush",
          "select": {
            "type": "interval",
            "encodings": ["x"],
            "resolve": "global"
          }
        }],
        // Grey background bars
      },
      {
        "transform": [{"filter": {"param": "brush"}}],
        // Blue selected bars
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Why This Works:
- The brush is defined **inside** the first layer of the repeat specification
- This ensures it's created once and shared across all repeated histograms
- No duplicate signal names are generated
- The pattern matches exactly what worked in your successful iterations

## Complete Features:
- ✅ Layered histograms (grey background + blue selection)
- ✅ Brush on any histogram updates all visualizations
- ✅ Dynamic X/Y axis selection for scatter plot
- ✅ Adjustable scatter plot density (1k-20k points)
- ✅ Export functionality (CSV format)
- ✅ Real-time selection statistics
- ✅ Dark theme throughout
- ✅ Fully offline (all libraries inlined)
- ✅ No external dependencies
