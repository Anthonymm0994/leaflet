# Multi-Section Histogram Highlighting

## ✅ Created `dashboard-multi-highlight.html`

This version implements the multi-section highlighting pattern from the Observable example you shared.

## How It Works:

1. **2D Brushing on Scatter Plot**
   - Brush creates a rectangular selection in the scatter plot
   - Selects points based on both X and Y axes

2. **Multi-Section Histogram Highlighting**
   - When you brush the scatter plot, the histograms show **multiple blue sections**
   - These sections represent where the selected scatter points fall in each dimension
   - Grey background bars show the full distribution for context

## Visual Example:
- If you select a cluster in the scatter plot (e.g., high age + high income)
- The age histogram will show blue bars in the "high age" bins
- The income histogram will show blue bars in the "high income" bins
- Other histograms show where those selected points fall in their distributions

## Key Differences:
- **Previous version**: 1D brushing on histograms creates continuous selections
- **This version**: 2D brushing on scatter creates multiple histogram sections

## Features:
- ✅ 2D interval selection on scatter plot
- ✅ Multi-section highlighting in all histograms
- ✅ Shows true distribution of selected points
- ✅ Grey background for full context
- ✅ Dynamic X/Y axis selection
- ✅ Export selected data
- ✅ Real-time statistics

This creates the exact visual effect from the Observable example where brushing the scatter plot reveals the distribution patterns across all dimensions!
