# Iteration 31 - Properly Tested Dashboard

## What's Fixed

The key fix was understanding that the `params` definition needs to be INSIDE the first layer, not at the top level of the spec. This is exactly how it works in the Iter 27 dashboard that was confirmed working.

## Key Pattern

```javascript
layer: [
    {
        // params goes HERE, inside the first layer
        params: [{
            name: 'brush',
            select: { 
                type: 'interval',
                encodings: ['x'],
                resolve: 'intersect'
            }
        }],
        mark: { type: 'bar', color: 'lightgrey' },
        // ... rest of first layer
    },
    {
        // second layer references the brush
        transform: [{ filter: { param: 'brush' } }],
        mark: { type: 'bar', color: '#1f77b4' },
        // ... rest of second layer
    }
]
```
