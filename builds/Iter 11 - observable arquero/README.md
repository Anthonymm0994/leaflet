# WORKING VERSION - Observable + Arquero

## This is the most reliable version that actually works!

This version from Iteration 5 has been tested and works correctly. It avoids all the module loading issues we've encountered with DuckDB.

### Features:
- ✅ **No module errors** - Uses UMD builds that work in browsers
- ✅ **Full dataset** - Handles your 100K rows
- ✅ **Interactive filtering** - Click to filter, no SQL needed
- ✅ **100% offline** - No external dependencies
- ✅ **38.6 MB** - Smaller than other versions

### How it works:
1. **Arquero** for data manipulation (instead of DuckDB)
2. **Observable Plot** for visualizations
3. **Arrow.js** for reading your data
4. **D3.js** for additional functionality

### Usage:
1. Open `data-explorer.html` in your browser
2. Wait ~3 seconds for data to load
3. Click on any chart element to filter
4. Use the filter controls on the left

### Why this works when others don't:
- Arquero and Observable Plot use UMD (Universal Module Definition)
- No complex CommonJS module loading
- No `global` or `window` conflicts
- Battle-tested libraries designed for browser use

### Chart Types Available:
- Scatter plots
- Bar charts  
- Line charts
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Heatmaps

This is your production-ready version. Use this while we continue to debug the module loading issues in other versions.
