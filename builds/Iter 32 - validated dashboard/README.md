# Iteration 32 - Validated Dashboard

## Approach

Started with a simple, working implementation to avoid syntax errors:

1. Simple vconcat layout (no repeat)
2. Two histograms with shared brush
3. Basic selection counting
4. Validated JavaScript syntax

## Features

- Simple linked brushing between two histograms
- Shows selection count
- Clear button
- No syntax errors
- Clean, minimal code

## Next Steps

Once this simple version works, we can gradually add:
- More histograms
- Scatter plot
- Layered visualization
- Export functionality

The key is to start simple and validate at each step.
