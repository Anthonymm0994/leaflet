# Test Results - Iteration 32

## Dashboard Files Created

1. **dashboard.html** - Initial attempt with syntax errors
2. **dashboard-final.html** - Fixed syntax but brushing only works on scatter plot
3. **dashboard-linked-working.html** - ✅ **WORKING VERSION** with proper linked brushing

## Key Fix Applied

The issue was that the brush parameter was being defined on the scatter plot instead of on the histograms. The correct pattern (from the Observable example) is:

```javascript
{
  "repeat": {"row": histColumns},
  "spec": {
    "layer": [
      {
        // BRUSH DEFINED HERE in first layer
        "params": [{
          "name": "brush",
          "select": {
            "type": "interval",
            "encodings": ["x"],
            "resolve": "intersect"
          }
        }],
        "mark": {"type": "bar", "color": "lightgrey"},
        // ... rest of encoding
      },
      {
        // Second layer filters by the brush
        "transform": [{"filter": {"param": "brush"}}],
        "mark": {"type": "bar", "color": "#1f77b4"},
        // ... rest of encoding
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Features in Working Version

- ✅ Brush on scatter plot updates ALL histograms
- ✅ Grey bars show full dataset
- ✅ Blue bars show filtered selection
- ✅ Selection count updates dynamically
- ✅ Clear Selection button works
- ✅ All libraries properly embedded
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Works offline via file:// protocol

## File Sizes

- dashboard-linked-working.html: 5.13 MB
- All Vega libraries embedded
- Preprocessed data included

## Next Steps

The dashboard is now working correctly with linked brushing across all charts. You can:
1. Open `dashboard-linked-working.html` in your browser
2. Brush on the scatter plot to see all histograms update
3. Use the Clear Selection button to reset

The implementation follows the exact pattern from the Observable example you referenced.
