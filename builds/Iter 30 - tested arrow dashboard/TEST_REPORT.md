# Dashboard Test Report - Iteration 30

## Test Date: 2025-08-03 16:25

### 1. Code Validation Tests

#### Signal Naming
- ✅ Each histogram has unique brush name (brush_age, brush_income, etc.)
- ✅ No duplicate signal errors

#### Offline Capability
- ✅ All libraries embedded inline
- ✅ No CDN references
- ✅ Works from file:// protocol

#### Arrow Optimization
- ✅ Uses TypedArrays efficiently
- ✅ Filters operate directly on TypedArrays
- ✅ Converts to objects only for visualization

### 2. Functionality Tests

#### Linked Brushing
- ✅ Single histogram selection filters all views
- ✅ Multiple selections create AND filters
- ✅ Scatter plot updates with filtered data
- ✅ All histograms show filtered subsets

#### Performance
- ✅ Debounced updates (100ms)
- ✅ Efficient TypedArray filtering
- ✅ Handles 10k displayed points smoothly

### 3. UI/UX Tests

#### Layout
- ✅ Three-panel responsive layout
- ✅ Proper spacing and alignment
- ✅ Scrollable histogram panel

#### Interactions
- ✅ Brush selections draggable
- ✅ Clear All button works
- ✅ Export generates valid CSV
- ✅ Axis selection updates scatter plot

### 4. Test Results

✅ All validation tests passed

### Summary

All critical tests passed. The dashboard properly implements linked brushing with unique signal names, leverages Arrow data efficiently through TypedArrays, and provides a professional user experience.

## Key Technical Improvements

1. **Unique Brush Names**: Each histogram has `brush_{column}` preventing conflicts
2. **TypedArray Efficiency**: Data stays in TypedArray format until visualization
3. **Smart Filtering**: Operates directly on TypedArrays for speed
4. **Proper Debouncing**: 100ms delay prevents excessive updates
