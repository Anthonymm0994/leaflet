A thoroughly tested dashboard that fixes all previous issues and leverages Arrow data efficiently.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Duplicate Signal Error - FIXED ✅
- Each histogram now has a unique brush name: `brush_age`, `brush_income`, etc.

- Filtering operates directly on TypedArrays
- Converts to objects only when needed for Vega

### 3. Proper Linked Brushing ✅
- Brushing ANY histogram filters ALL visualizations
- Multiple brushes create AND filters (intersection)
- Scatter plot updates with filtered data
