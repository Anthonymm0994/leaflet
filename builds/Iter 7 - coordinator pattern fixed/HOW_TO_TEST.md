# How to Test the Fixed Coordinator Version

## Quick Test

1. **Open the HTML file** in your browser:
   - Navigate to: `builds/Iter 7 - coordinator pattern fixed/data-explorer.html`
   - Double-click to open in your default browser

2. **Check the Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab):
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Common issues and fixes below

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you should see:
1. Loading spinner for 3-5 seconds
2. Dashboard with 4 interactive charts:
   - Time distribution (minute bins)
   - Width histogram
   - Category bar chart
   - Height vs Angle scatter plot
3. Click any bar/category to filter all charts
4. Filter chips appear at the top
5. "Clear All Filters" button when filters active

## Common Issues & Fixes

### "module is not defined"
This was the issue you reported. The fixed version includes:
```javascript
window.module = { exports: {} };
window.exports = window.module.exports;
```

### "Cannot read property 'AsyncDuckDB' of undefined"
The DuckDB module didn't load properly. The fixed version uses:
```javascript
window.DuckDB = module.exports;
```

### Charts not appearing
Check if Arrow data loaded - should see row count in console

## Testing the Coordinator Pattern

1. **Click a time bar** → Should filter all other charts
2. **Click a category** → Should update counts in other views  
3. **Click "Clear All Filters"** → Should reset everything

## Performance Check

With 100K rows, expect:
- Initial load: 3-5 seconds
- Filter updates: <200ms
- Smooth interactions

## Alternative: Simple Test Server

If file:// protocol causes issues:
```bash
cd "builds/Iter 7 - coordinator pattern fixed"
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000/data-explorer.html
```

## Still Having Issues?

The most reliable version is still **Iter 5** (Observable + Arquero) if you need something working immediately. This coordinator version is more advanced but also more complex.
