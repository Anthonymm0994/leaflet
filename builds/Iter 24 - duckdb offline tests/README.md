# DuckDB Offline Test Results

## Summary

DuckDB-WASM **does not work** for offline HTML files due to fundamental architectural requirements:

1. **Web Workers** - Requires separate .js files that can't be inlined
2. **WASM Loading** - Browsers block WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming on file://
3. **SharedArrayBuffer** - Required for threading, disabled on file:// protocol
4. **Module Imports** - Dynamic imports fail with local files

## Test Files

### test1-cdn-version.html
- Shows DuckDB working perfectly when loaded from CDN
- Requires internet connection
- This is how it's meant to be used

### test2-inline-attempt.html
- Explains why inlining fails
- Lists all the technical blockers
- Shows typical error messages

### test3-blob-url-attempt.html
- Tests Blob URL workarounds
- Shows that simple Workers can work
- But DuckDB's complexity exceeds what's possible

### test4-sql-js-alternative.html
- Demonstrates SQL.js as a simpler alternative
- Works offline but limited features
- No Arrow support, single-threaded

### test5-arquero-alternative.html
- **Best solution for offline use**
- Pure JavaScript, no WASM
- Excellent Arrow integration
- DataFrame API instead of SQL

## Recommendations

For offline HTML reports with 100k+ data points:

1. **Use Arquero** for data processing
2. **Use Vega-Lite** for visualizations
3. **Avoid DuckDB-WASM** entirely
4. **Consider SQL.js** only if SQL is absolutely required

The combination of Arquero + Vega-Lite provides:
- Full offline capability
- Excellent performance
- Arrow data support
- Interactive visualizations
- Reasonable file sizes

## Technical Details

### Why DuckDB-WASM Fails Offline

```javascript
// This is what DuckDB tries to do:
const worker = new Worker('./duckdb-browser.worker.js');
// ERROR: Not allowed to load local resource

const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
    fetch('./duckdb-browser.wasm')
);
// ERROR: Failed to fetch

const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
// ERROR: SharedArrayBuffer is not defined
```

### Why Arquero Works

```javascript
// Arquero is pure JavaScript:
import * as aq from './arquero.min.js';
// Works perfectly!

const table = aq.table(data);
const result = table.filter(d => d.value > 100);
// No WASM, no Workers, just JavaScript
```

## Conclusion

While DuckDB-WASM is an amazing technology, it's designed for server environments or online applications. For offline HTML reports, traditional JavaScript libraries like Arquero paired with visualization libraries like Vega-Lite are the optimal choice.
